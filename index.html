<h3> Reviews From Members: </h3><br> <br>
Kathy, 23 (Ocean City, MD) <br>
	"Ever since I joined back in 2019 I haven't had any issues on when and where I'm able to workout and every month there seems to be a new addition opening in each of the Colin's Gyms that are in my area! I couldn't imagine going to another gym! <br> <br> 
Todd, 64 (Towson, MD) <br>
	"It's been a long time since I joined a gym but Colin's Gym blew what I knew about gyms out of the water! There's always the right equipment and weights available when I go so I don't have to stop my workout. It's even like that when it's busy! <br> <br> 
Kevin, 33 (Erie, PA) <br>
	"Ever since my kids, I was never able to find time to go to the gym because it always seemed like it was closed or too far away at the times I was able to go. The variety of Colin's Gyms has helped me get back into working out on my time. </p>
